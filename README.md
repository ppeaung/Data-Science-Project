# Data-Science-Project

This repository contains the files used to create the visualizations and the ensemble method for the final project for CS 575 Data Science. We note that this was a specific case study done on Alabama and assumptions used in generating the ensemble (via the ReCom MCMC algorithm) are not used in litigation. For example, we do not using the voting age population but rather general population in our analysis. Nonetheless, it gives a good approximation of redistricting maps.
